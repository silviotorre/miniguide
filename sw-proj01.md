act as an expert programmer. what are the simpliest way to write new commercial program for remote assistence to a pc, using free libraries?


The simplest way to write a new commercial program for remote assistance to a PC, using free libraries, is to use a library such as libVNCServer or libVNCClient. These libraries provide a set of APIs that allow you to easily create a remote assistance program. Additionally, they provide support for various encryption algorithms, which can be used to secure the connection between the client and the server. Other libraries, such as libssh, can also be used to provide secure remote access to a PC.

lets start to project this new program

The first step in creating a new commercial program for remote assistance to a PC is to decide on the features and functionality that the program should provide. This will help to determine which libraries and APIs should be used. Once the features and functionality have been determined, the next step is to create the program's user interface. This can be done using a library such as Qt or GTK+.

The next step is to create the program's backend. This will involve writing code to interact with the libraries and APIs that have been chosen. This code should be written in a language such as C++ or Java. Once the backend has been created, the program should be tested to ensure that it is working correctly.

Finally, the program should be packaged and distributed. This can be done using a package manager such as apt or yum. Additionally, the program can be distributed via a website or other online platform.

first version is only for windows, common features to use a library such as libVNCServer or libVNCClient and crypotograpy on connection and auto startup, client side we need a minimal web interface based noVNC 

To create a program for Windows that uses libVNCServer or libVNCClient and provides encryption on the connection, as well as an auto-startup feature, the first step is to create the program's user interface. This can be done using a library such as Qt or GTK+. Once the user interface has been created, the next step is to create the program's backend. This will involve writing code to interact with the libraries and APIs that have been chosen. This code should be written in a language such as C++ or Java.

Once the backend has been created, the program should be tested to ensure that it is working correctly. Additionally, a minimal web interface based on noVNC should be created to provide the client-side of the program. This web interface should be tested to ensure that it is working correctly.

Finally, the program should be packaged and distributed. This can be done using a package manager such as apt or yum. Additionally, the program can be distributed via a website or other online platform.
