# Pipelines in Bash & PowerShell

## üìå Introduction
Pipelines allow you to pass the output of one command as input to another, enabling efficient data processing. This cheatsheet provides examples of sorting, filtering, and presenting data using pipelines in Bash and PowerShell.

## üêß Bash Examples

### Sorting
```bash
cat file.txt | sort
```
Sorts the contents of `file.txt` alphabetically.

### Filtering
```bash
cat file.txt | grep "pattern"
```
Filters lines in `file.txt` that match the specified pattern.

### Presenting Data
```bash
ls -l | awk '{print $9, $5}'
```
Displays the file name and size from the `ls -l` command output.

## üñ•Ô∏è PowerShell Examples

### Sorting
```powershell
Get-Content file.txt | Sort-Object
```
Sorts the contents of `file.txt` alphabetically.

### Filtering
```powershell
Get-Content file.txt | Where-Object { $_ -match "pattern" }
```
Filters lines in `file.txt` that match the specified pattern. You can also check for a specific string using findstr (_findsrt_ is a Windows command-line utility):
```powershell
Get-ChildItem | findstr "pattern"
```

### Presenting Data
```powershell
Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length
```
Displays the file name and size from the `Get-ChildItem` command output.
### Display as table
```powershell
Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length | Format-Table -AutoSize
```
displays the file name and size from the `Get-ChildItem` command output in a table format. you can also use `Format-List` to display the output in a list format:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length | Format-List
```
### Display as grid
```powershell
Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length | Out-GridView
```
This command displays the file name and size from the `Get-ChildItem` command output in a grid view, allowing for easier data exploration.
### Display as chart
```powershell
Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length | Out-Chart
``` 
This command displays the file name and size from the `Get-ChildItem` command output in a chart format, allowing for visual representation of the data.
